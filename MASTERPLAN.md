# Project Tahoe - Simplified Masterplan

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: Exploratory Development

---

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. ADK Knowledge Limitations
**You (the AI assistant) do not have training on Google ADK** - it was released after your training cutoff. Therefore:
- **Never assume** how ADK works or make guesses about its API
- **Always reference documentation** before writing any ADK-related code
- **Consult the docs frequently** even for seemingly simple operations
- **Verify assumptions** by checking the official documentation

#### Primary Documentation Sources
- **Local Documentation**: `/adk_docs_markdown/` - Complete ADK documentation in markdown format
  - See `_SUMMARY.md` for documentation structure
  - API Reference: `/adk_docs_markdown/api-reference_python.md`
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/google/adk-python

When encountering any ADK-related task:
1. First, check the relevant documentation section
2. Then, implement based on documented examples
3. Finally, test to verify the implementation works as expected

### 2. KISS Principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **Start with the simplest possible implementation** that works
- **Avoid premature optimization** or complex abstractions
- **Fail fast** with clear, descriptive error messages
- **Local development environment** should mirror production setup
- **Prioritize clean, readable code** over backwards compatibility (pre-launch)
- **Build incrementally** - get basic functionality working before adding features

## Vision

Build a universal agent orchestration service using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) that enables dynamic, configuration-driven agent composition for any domain or use case. This standalone service will serve as the core engine for future agentic products.

## Conceptual Overview

Tahoe is envisioned as a service that allows client applications to:
- Create agents dynamically via API
- Manage agent lifecycles and configurations
- Execute agent tasks through API calls
- Maintain agent sessions and state

The exact architecture will emerge through exploration and experimentation with ADK, but the core concept is to abstract agent complexity behind a clean API interface.

## Core Principles

### 1. Configuration-Driven Design
- Agents and workflows defined through configuration files (JSON/YAML)
- No hardcoded business logic or domain assumptions
- Runtime flexibility through parameterization

### 2. Universal Orchestration
- Support any type of agent composition pattern
- Enable complex workflows without code changes
- Adapt to any problem domain through configuration

### 3. Incremental Development
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Learn ADK capabilities through hands-on exploration
- Validate assumptions through implementation

### 4. Documentation-First Approach
- Study ADK documentation thoroughly before implementation
- Test each ADK feature independently
- Build understanding through experimentation

## Architecture Overview

### Service Architecture
**Tahoe** will operate as a standalone agent orchestration service:
- Runs on its own DNS endpoint (e.g., `tahoe.internal.company.com`)
- Secured via internal service token authentication
- RESTful API for all agent operations
- Acts as the core agent engine for future products
- Abstracts ADK complexity behind simple API calls

### Conceptual API Capabilities
While the exact implementation will be discovered through exploration, we envision APIs that enable:
```
CREATE → CONFIGURE → EXECUTE → MANAGE
```

- **Create**: Instantiate new agents from specifications
- **Configure**: Modify agent behaviors and capabilities
- **Execute**: Run agents with inputs and receive outputs
- **Manage**: Handle sessions, state, and agent lifecycles

### Integration Model
```
[Product Services] → API → [Tahoe Agent Service] → [ADK Framework]
```

Future products will:
- Use Tahoe as their agent execution engine
- Send requests to create/run agents via API
- Receive responses without knowing ADK implementation details
- Focus on business logic while Tahoe handles agent orchestration

## What We Want to Achieve

- **Fail fast**: Quick prototypes to validate assumptions
- **Share learnings**: Regular knowledge sharing sessions
- **Iterative refinement**: Masterplan evolves with understanding

## Conclusion

Project Tahoe aims to create a universal agent orchestration layer on top of Google ADK. Rather than prescribing specific implementations, this masterplan establishes principles and goals while acknowledging that the path forward requires careful exploration of ADK's actual capabilities.

The key to success is maintaining flexibility while working incrementally through the documentation, testing assumptions, and building understanding through hands-on implementation. This document will evolve as we learn more about what's possible with ADK.
