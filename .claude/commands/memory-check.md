# Quick Memory Check

Quickly scan the memory bank and tell me:
1. What are we currently working on? (from context.md)
2. Are there any blocking issues?
3. What's the next priority?
4. Are there any active reference documents I should know about?

This is for mid-session reality checks without full re-reading.
