# End Development Session

Please close this session by updating the memory bank:

1. Update `memory-bank/context.md`:
   - Current date/time
   - What was accomplished
   - Any discoveries or issues
   - Specific next steps
   - Current file states

2. Update `memory-bank/progress.md`:
   - Move completed items to "Completed"
   - Update "In Progress" status
   - Add new upcoming work discovered
   - Update or remove reference links

3. Update `memory-bank/architecture.md` if:
   - New patterns were established
   - Technical decisions were made
   - Integration points changed

4. Update `memory-bank/decisions.md` if:
   - Any project decisions were made
   - Rationale for choices needs documenting

5. **Archive Management**:
   - Only archive documents that are truly no longer needed:
     - Implementation plans that are fully executed
     - Investigation docs where findings are now integrated
     - Temporary tracking documents that served their purpose
   - Keep active even if "complete":
     - Reference architectures still being followed
     - Design docs still guiding development
     - Any document still being referenced
   - When archiving:
     - Move to `memory-bank/archive/` with date prefix
     - Format: `archive/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
     - Remove references from memory bank files

6. Provide a summary of:
   - What was updated in each file
   - What was archived (if anything) and why
   - What completed docs were kept active and why
