## Memory Bank System
- **Active context**: `/memory-bank/` - Living project documents
  - `context.md` - Session handoffs and current state
  - `architecture.md` - Technical patterns and decisions  
  - `progress.md` - Development status tracking
  - `decisions.md` - Key project decisions log
- **Archived docs**: `/memory-bank/archive/` - Completed plans

## IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO FOLLOW
- KISS: Keep implementations simple and straightforward
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Local dev environment mirrors production
- Clean code over backwards compatibility (pre-launch)
- You are an LLM with a training cutoff before Googleâ€™s ADK was released, so you are not trained on it. Reference the documentation frequently and consistently. Do not make assumptions or guess how to use ADK without consulting the documentation: https://google.github.io/adk-docs/

## Google ADK Documentation
When encountering ADK-related issues, consult official documentation first:
- Main Docs: https://google.github.io/adk-docs/
- GitHub: https://github.com/google/adk-python
- API Reference: https://google.github.io/adk-docs/api-reference/python/
