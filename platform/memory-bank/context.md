# Platform Service Development Context

## Last Session: August 15, 2025, 4:58 PM PST

### What Was Accomplished (Phase 1, Session 1: Service Setup & Database)

 **Complete success - All Phase 1, Session 1 objectives achieved:**

1. **Service Foundation Created**
   - Platform service directory structure established
   - TypeScript configuration with proper tsconfig.json
   - Package.json with all required dependencies
   - Jest testing setup configured

2. **Docker Infrastructure Implemented**
   - Dockerfile with Node.js Alpine + OpenSSL dependencies
   - docker-compose.yml following Tahoe patterns
   - Service runs on port 9200 as specified
   - Health checks and container management working

3. **Database Integration Complete**
   - Prisma schema designed to coexist with transcription service tables
   - Successful connection to shared PostgreSQL database
   - Database schema pushed and verified
   - Complete data models: Tenant, User, ApiKey, Session, FeatureFlag, Event

4. **Code Architecture Established**
   - TypeScript repositories for all models
   - Database configuration with proper connection management
   - Logging setup with Winston
   - Type definitions and interfaces

5. **Testing Framework Ready**
   - Unit tests for database connection
   - Repository tests for basic model operations
   - Integration tests for health endpoints
   - Test setup with proper database handling

6. **Service Integration Complete**
   - Updated main Makefile with platform service commands
   - Service successfully running and healthy
   - Health endpoints responding correctly
   - Integrated with tahoe-network and shared infrastructure

### Technical Discoveries

1. **Prisma + Alpine Linux Issue Resolved**
   - Initially encountered missing OpenSSL libraries in Alpine
   - Fixed by adding `openssl libc6-compat` packages to Dockerfile
   - Prisma client generation now works correctly in container

2. **Database Schema Coexistence**
   - Platform service tables successfully coexist with transcription service
   - Used `prisma db push` to avoid migration conflicts
   - All platform models properly isolated with tenant_id patterns

3. **Service Architecture Validation**
   - Express.js server structure working correctly
   - Database connection patterns established
   - Repository pattern implementation successful

### Current System State

**Infrastructure:**
- PostgreSQL: Running and healthy on tahoe-network
- Redis: Running and healthy on tahoe-network  
- Platform Service: Running on port 9200, healthy status

**Service Status:**
```
tahoe-platform container: Up and healthy
Health endpoint: http://localhost:9200/health 
Root endpoint: http://localhost:9200/ 
Database connection: Established and working 
```

**Code State:**
- All Phase 1, Session 1 files created and working
- Docker build successful and optimized
- Tests passing (database connectivity verified)
- Makefile commands operational

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2, Session 2)

**Authentication System Implementation:**
1. JWT token generation/validation utilities
2. Password hashing with bcrypt implementation  
3. Login/logout API endpoints
4. Session management with Redis integration
5. Refresh token flow
6. Basic authentication middleware

**Key Technical Tasks:**
- Implement `src/utils/jwt.ts` for token management
- Create `src/utils/password.ts` for bcrypt operations
- Build `src/middleware/auth.ts` for request validation
- Add `src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` for login endpoints
- Set up Redis client for session storage

### Development Environment

- Working directory: `/Users/gregspillane/Documents/Projects/tahoe/platform`
- All dependencies installed and configured
- Docker containers running and healthy
- Database schema applied and verified
- Testing framework ready for expansion

### Files Ready for Next Session

**Core Service Files:**
- `src/main.ts` - Express server (ready for route expansion)
- `src/config/database.ts` - Database connection (working)
- `src/repositories/*.ts` - Data access layer (complete)
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions (needs auth types)

**Infrastructure Files:**
- `Dockerfile` - Container config (optimized and working)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration (integrated)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (applied)
- `.env` - Environment configuration (ready)

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Service documentation (created)
- `MASTERPLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap (reference)
