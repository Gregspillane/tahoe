# Task Completion Validation

## Your Task
Validate the just-completed task implementation against @MASTERPLAN.md before proceeding to the next task. Ensure we're building the right thing with production-quality code that serves the application's intended purpose.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Task Implementation Review
Review what was just built:
- Core functionality delivered
- Integration points created
- Business logic implemented
- Technical decisions made

### 2. Spirit of the Application Check
Beyond literal compliance, verify the implementation serves the application's purpose:
- **User Experience**: Does this make the intended workflow better/easier?
- **Business Goals**: Does it advance the core value proposition?
- **System Coherence**: Does it fit naturally with existing components?
- **Future Readiness**: Does it enable planned features without blocking them?

### 3. Masterplan Alignment
Cross-reference implementation with @MASTERPLAN.md:
- Matches specified architecture patterns
- Follows documented user journeys
- Implements business rules correctly
- Respects technical constraints

### 4. Code Quality Scan
Check for issues that will cause problems later:
- Workarounds or temporary fixes
- TODOs/FIXMEs left in code
- Missing error handling
- Code duplication or complexity
- Untested critical paths

### 5. Cross-Task Impact
Verify this task's implementation:
- Properly integrates with previous tasks
- Sets up clean interfaces for upcoming tasks
- Doesn't break existing functionality
- Maintains consistent patterns
