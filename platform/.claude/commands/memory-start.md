# Start Development Session

Please begin this session by:

1. Read @MASTERPLAN.md to understand project foundation
2. Read all files in @memory-bank/ directory:
   - @memory-bank/context.md - for session handoff and current state
   - @memory-bank/architecture.md - for technical patterns
   - @memory-bank/progress.md - for development status
   - @memory-bank/decisions.md - for key project decisions

3. Check any active references marked with [ ] checkboxes

4. Summarize your understanding:
   - Current development focus
   - Key constraints or patterns to follow
   - Any blocking issues
   - Next immediate steps

5. Ask: "Based on the memory bank, should we continue with [X] or is there a different priority?"

Note: If you need deeper project context, reference @MASTERPLAN.md for complete details.

Do not proceed until you've read these files and confirmed the development direction.
