# Session Context - Project Tahoe

## Current Session
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-13 20:45 PST
**Focus**: R2 Task Validation and Correction - Aligned R2-T1 with MASTERPLAN requirements

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Task Validation Against MASTERPLAN**
   - Thoroughly validated R2-T1 orchestration engine task against MASTERPLAN
   - Identified missing elements and inaccuracies:
     - Missing ADK imports from the start
     - Incorrect file creation (analysis.py not needed)
     - Missing helper methods (_should_activate_agent, _group_by_execution_order, _update_session_phase)
     - Missing stub classes for AgentFactory and ResultAggregator

2. **Task Correction Implementation**
   - Updated R2-T1 task YAML with all corrections
   - Added proper ADK imports requirement
   - Added stub class implementations instead of pure mocks
   - Included all helper methods from MASTERPLAN
   - Aligned workflow phases with proper session management

## Discoveries/Issues
- **Task Alignment**: Original R2 tasks needed significant corrections to match MASTERPLAN
- **Interface Consistency**: Important to use stub classes rather than pure mocks to maintain proper interfaces for future integration
- **Helper Methods**: MASTERPLAN includes critical helper methods that were missing from original task specification
- **ADK Integration**: ADK should be imported from the start, even if using mock implementations

## Specific Next Steps
1. **Implement R2-T1: Orchestration Engine**
   - Create full orchestrator implementation with all helper methods
   - Build ContentAnalyzer service
   - Create AgentFactory stub class
   - Create ResultAggregator stub class
   - Write comprehensive tests

2. **After R2-T1 Complete**
   - R2-T2: Implement full AgentFactory (replace stub)
   - R2-T3: Build Model Registry
   - R2-T4: Complete Result Aggregation (replace stub)

3. **Validation Pattern**
   - Consider validating other R2 tasks (T2, T3, T4) against MASTERPLAN before implementation

## Current File States
### Modified Task Files
- `/tasks/r2-orchestration/r2-t1-orchestration-engine.yaml` - Corrected and aligned with MASTERPLAN

### Infrastructure Files (Unchanged)
- `/services/infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` - Running PostgreSQL & Redis
- All database schema and seed data intact from R1-T2

### Key Documents
- `MASTERPLAN.md` - Reference for all implementations
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions with correct ports
- Task specifications in `/tasks/` - R1 complete, R2-T1 corrected and ready

## Environment Configuration
```bash
# Infrastructure Services (shared)
POSTGRES_PORT=5435
REDIS_PORT=6382

# Agent-Engine Service
API_PORT=8001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tahoe:tahoe@localhost:5435/tahoe
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6382

# Note: DATABASE_URL must be exported for Prisma CLI operations
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tahoe:tahoe@localhost:5435/tahoe
```

## Session Handoff
**Task Validation Complete!** R2-T1 has been thoroughly validated and corrected against MASTERPLAN:
- All missing components identified and added
- Task YAML updated with proper stub implementations
- Ready for implementation following corrected specification
- Consider validating remaining R2 tasks before implementation

**Next Session: Implement R2-T1 Orchestration Engine**
Follow the corrected task specification to build the complete orchestration engine.
