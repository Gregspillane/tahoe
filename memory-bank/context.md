# Project Tahoe - Session Context

## Last Updated
- **Date**: 2025-08-13
- **Session Focus**: R1 Foundation Task Creation

## Current State

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Created comprehensive task structure** for Project Tahoe universal agent engine
   - Generated 7 releases with 33 total tasks
   - Created master release plan (`tasks/releases.yaml`)
   - Built complete R1 Foundation tasks (5 YAML files)

2. **Established project documentation**:
   - `tasks/project-context.md`: Persistent context across all tasks
   - `tasks/adk-patterns.md`: Verified ADK best practices and patterns
   - `tasks/task-dependencies.md`: Complete dependency graph and implementation strategy

3. **Created validation infrastructure**:
   - `tasks/validation/validate-tasks.py`: Python script to validate all task files
   - Dependency checking and release validation
   - Mermaid graph generation capability

4. **Defined R1 Foundation tasks**:
   - r1-t01: Project setup with ADK environment
   - r1-t02: ADK component verification
   - r1-t03: Specification system (YAML/JSON parser)
   - r1-t04: Database setup with Prisma
   - r1-t05: Configuration loader system

### Discoveries & Key Insights
- ADK components are well-documented and follow consistent patterns
- Task structure needs to be highly detailed for autonomous execution
- Each task averages 500+ lines of YAML with comprehensive instructions
- Dependencies between tasks are complex but manageable with proper tracking

### Current File States
- `MASTERPLAN.md`: Unchanged, serving as reference
- `tasks/` directory: Fully structured with R1 tasks complete
- `TASK_CREATOR.md`: Instructions followed, can be archived after R7
- Memory bank files: Newly created/updated

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session - R2 Composition)
1. **Create R2 Composition task files** (6 tasks):
   - r2-t01: Agent factory base structure
   - r2-t02: LLM agent builder implementation
   - r2-t03: Workflow agents (Sequential, Parallel, Loop)
   - r2-t04: Custom agent support
   - r2-t05: Runner integration with ADK
   - r2-t06: Comprehensive composition tests

2. **Create R3 Tools task files** (4 tasks):
   - r3-t01: Tool registry core
   - r3-t02: Dynamic tool loading
   - r3-t03: Built-in tools library
   - r3-t04: Tool collections and categories

### Implementation Ready
- R1 Foundation tasks are complete and ready for implementation
- Each task has validation commands and success criteria
- ADK patterns documented and verified

### Dependencies to Track
- R2 tasks depend on R1-t02 (ADK verification), R1-t03 (specifications), R1-t05 (configuration)
- R3 tasks depend on R1-t05 (configuration) and R2-t01 (agent factory base)

## Environment Status
- Working directory: `/Users/gregspillane/Documents/Projects/tahoe`
- Git status: Modified files (masterplan.md, TASK_CREATOR.md untracked)
- Python environment: Not yet created (will be in R1-t01)
- ADK: Not yet installed (will be in R1-t01)

## Session Notes
- Task creation approach is working well - highly detailed YAML files
- Validation script will be crucial for maintaining task quality
- Consider creating task templates for remaining releases
- May need to adjust time estimates based on actual implementation
