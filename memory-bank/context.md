# Session Context - Project Tahoe

## Current Session
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-13 18:05 PST
**Focus**: R1-T2 Database Schema Implementation - Complete Prisma setup with infrastructure refactoring

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Major Infrastructure Refactoring**
   - Separated PostgreSQL and Redis into `services/infrastructure/`
   - Created shared infrastructure docker-compose for all services
   - Updated agent-engine to connect to external services
   - Established proper monorepo pattern with service independence

2. **Completed R1-T2 Database Schema**
   - Implemented all 8 tables from masterplan (AgentTemplate, Scorecard, etc.)
   - Set up Prisma ORM with Python client
   - Created comprehensive seed script with sample data
   - Built database helper utilities and CRUD tests
   - All tests passing with full database connectivity

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Updated config.py with computed fields for DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL
   - Proper environment variable handling
   - Service URLs computed based on environment (dev/staging/prod)

## Discoveries/Issues
- **Critical Architecture Decision**: PostgreSQL and Redis should be shared infrastructure, not embedded in services
- Prisma requires DATABASE_URL environment variable separately from application config
- Config.py was enhanced with computed fields for better configuration management
- Each service will use database schemas (agent_engine, auth, billing) for isolation

## Specific Next Steps
1. **Option A: Continue with R1-T3 Basic API**
   - Implement authentication endpoints
   - Add service-to-service token validation
   - Create basic CRUD endpoints for agents/scorecards

2. **Option B: Start R2 Orchestration Engine**
   - Build orchestrator.py with ADK integration
   - Implement agent factory pattern
   - Create execution pipeline

3. **Infrastructure Considerations**
   - Future services will connect to same PostgreSQL/Redis instances
   - Each service gets its own schema and Redis namespace
   - Consider adding pgAdmin or Redis Commander for debugging

## Current File States
### Infrastructure Files
- `/services/infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` - Shared PostgreSQL & Redis
- `/services/infrastructure/README.md` - Infrastructure documentation

### Agent-Engine Service Files
- `/services/agent-engine/prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete 8-table schema
- `/services/agent-engine/scripts/seed.py` - Database seeding with sample data
- `/services/agent-engine/src/models/database.py` - Database utilities
- `/services/agent-engine/src/config.py` - Enhanced with computed fields
- `/services/agent-engine/src/main.py` - Integrated with Prisma
- `/services/agent-engine/tests/test_database.py` - CRUD test suite
- `/services/agent-engine/.env` - Local development configuration
- `/services/agent-engine/docker-compose.yml` - Service-only container

### Key Documents
- `masterplan.md` - Complete technical blueprint (reference)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with infrastructure pattern
- Task specifications in `/tasks/` - All 10 tasks ready

## Environment Configuration
```bash
# Infrastructure Services (shared)
POSTGRES_PORT=5435
REDIS_PORT=6382

# Agent-Engine Service
API_PORT=8001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tahoe:tahoe@localhost:5435/tahoe
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6382

# Note: DATABASE_URL must be exported for Prisma CLI operations
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tahoe:tahoe@localhost:5435/tahoe
```

## Session Handoff
R1-T2 complete with infrastructure properly separated. Database schema fully implemented with seed data. Next session options:
1. **R1-T3**: Add authentication and basic API endpoints
2. **R2-T1**: Start building the orchestration engine with ADK
3. Both paths are viable - R1-T3 completes foundation, R2-T1 starts core functionality

All infrastructure is running and tested. FastAPI app connects successfully to both PostgreSQL and Redis.
