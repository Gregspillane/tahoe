# Session Context - Project Tahoe

## Current Session
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-13 17:22 PST
**Focus**: R1-T1 Project Setup Implementation - Docker Environment and Basic Structure

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Completed R1-T1 Project Setup Task**
   - Created services/agent-engine directory structure
   - Built minimal FastAPI application with health endpoint
   - Set up Docker Compose environment with PostgreSQL and Redis
   - Configured all services with correct ports (8001, 5435, 6382)
   - All containers running successfully with health checks passing

2. **Infrastructure Decisions**
   - Moved infrastructure to services/infrastructure (monorepo pattern)
   - Each service is self-contained with its own Docker setup
   - Shared infrastructure available as separate service

3. **Fixed Configuration Issues**
   - Resolved FastAPI/Starlette dependency conflicts
   - Removed obsolete docker-compose version attributes
   - Created pyproject.toml for Python project configuration
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with correct port references

## Discoveries/Issues
- Google ADK installed successfully (already present on system)
- Dependency conflict between FastAPI 0.115.0 and google-adk requiring different Starlette versions
- Resolved by using flexible version constraints (>=) instead of pinned versions
- Port 8001 is correct per task specification (not 8000 from masterplan)

## Specific Next Steps
1. **Execute R1-T2 Database Configuration**
   - Implement complete Prisma schema from masterplan
   - Set up agent_templates, scorecards, portfolios tables
   - Configure database migrations
   - Test database connectivity and schema

2. **Continue Foundation Tasks**
   - R1-T3: Basic API with authentication after database is ready
   - Validate each component before proceeding

3. **Validation Points**
   - Database schema properly created in PostgreSQL
   - Prisma client generation working
   - Models accessible from FastAPI application

## Current File States
### Created Files
- `/tasks/releases.yaml` - Master release overview with 3 releases
- `/tasks/shared/project-context.md` - Shared context for all tasks
- `/tasks/r1-foundation/` - 3 task files for foundation infrastructure
- `/tasks/r2-orchestration/` - 4 task files for orchestration engine
- `/tasks/r3-specialist-agents/` - 3 task files for specialist agents

### Key Documents
- `masterplan.md` - Complete technical blueprint (reference)
- `roadmap.md` - Development roadmap (reference)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions for Claude Code

## Environment Configuration
```bash
# Updated ports for agent-engine service
API_PORT=8001
POSTGRES_PORT=5435
REDIS_PORT=6382

# Connection strings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://tahoe:tahoe@localhost:5435/tahoe
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6382
```

## Session Handoff
The task specifications are complete and ready for implementation. The next session should:
1. Read `/tasks/r1-foundation/r1-t1-project-setup.yaml`
2. Create the services/agent-engine directory structure
3. Implement the Docker Compose environment with updated ports
4. Validate the basic infrastructure is running

All task files include detailed implementation guides, validation steps, and connection information. Follow the KISS principle throughout implementation.
