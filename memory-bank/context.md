# Project Tahoe - Session Context

## Last Updated
- **Date**: 2025-08-13 (Late Evening)
- **Session Focus**: R2 Composition and R3 Tools Task Creation

## Current State

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Successfully implemented R1-T01 Project Setup**:
   - Created complete monorepo structure with services/agent-engine directory
   - Set up Python 3.12 virtual environment with all dependencies
   - Installed Google ADK package and verified all imports work
   - Created FastAPI application with health endpoint
   - Set up Docker configuration (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml)
   - Initialized environment configuration files (.env and development.env)
   - Tested FastAPI server - runs successfully on port 8001

2. **Project Structure Created**:
   ```

   ```

### Discoveries & Key Insights
- ADK installation via pip works smoothly (google-adk package)
- ADK imports generate a warning about field shadowing in SequentialAgent (non-critical)
- All critical ADK components verified working:
  - Agents: LlmAgent, SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent, BaseAgent
  - Runners: InMemoryRunner
  - Sessions: InMemorySessionService
  - Tools: FunctionTool
- FastAPI integrates well with the project structure
- Python 3.12 compatible with all dependencies

### Current File States
- `services/agent-engine/src/main.py`: FastAPI application with health endpoint
- `services/agent-engine/requirements.txt`: Complete dependency list including google-adk
- `docker-compose.yml`: Services for postgres, redis, and agent-engine
- `.env`: Base configuration with placeholders for API keys
- `config/development.env`: Development overrides
- `venv/`: Python 3.12 virtual environment with all packages installed
- Task r1-t01-project-setup.yaml: Successfully implemented
- R2 Composition tasks: All 6 task files created
- R3 Tools tasks: All 4 task files created

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Execute R1-T02: ADK Component Verification**
   - Build upon the working ADK installation
   - Create comprehensive test suite for all ADK components
   - Document component capabilities and limitations

2. **Then proceed with remaining R1 tasks**:
   - R1-T03: Specification system (YAML/JSON parser)
   - R1-T04: Database setup with Prisma
   - R1-T05: Configuration loader system

### Implementation Ready
- Environment is fully set up and working
- ADK is installed and imports verified
- FastAPI server runs successfully
- Ready to build agent components on this foundation

### Dependencies Cleared
- R1-T01 ✅ Complete - unblocks all other R1 tasks
- Can now proceed with parallel implementation of R1-T02 through R1-T05

## Environment Status
- Working directory: `/Users/gregspillane/Documents/Projects/tahoe`
- Git status: Multiple new files added (services/, config/, docker-compose.yml, .env)
- Python environment: ✅ Created (Python 3.12 venv)
- ADK: ✅ Installed (google-adk 1.10.0)
- FastAPI: ✅ Running (tested on port 8001)
- Dependencies: ✅ All installed via pip

## Session Notes
- R1-T01 implementation completed successfully in ~30 minutes
- Task YAML structure proved very effective for guided implementation
- All specified ADK imports work correctly
- Minor warning about field shadowing in SequentialAgent (non-breaking)
- Need to update GEMINI_API_KEY in .env before using ADK agents
- Docker services (postgres, redis) configured but not started yet
- Development environment fully operational
- Successfully created all R2 Composition task files (6 tasks)
- Successfully created all R3 Tools task files (4 tasks)
- Task validation script runs but reports missing R4-R7 tasks (expected)
- 15 of 33 total task files now created (45%)
