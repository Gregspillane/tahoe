# Tahoe Development Context

## Last Session: 2025-08-14
**Time**: 05:50 AM UTC
**Duration**: ~1 hour

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete Project Foundation 
- Reviewed and fixed MASTERPLAN.md formatting issues
- Thoroughly researched ADK documentation (scraped all 73 pages locally)
- Designed project structure aligned with ADK capabilities
- Implemented core infrastructure:
  - Agent Factory for dynamic agent creation
  - Config Loader for YAML/JSON specifications
  - FastAPI-based REST API
  - Docker-based development environment

### 2. Docker Environment Setup 
- Updated all services to use port 9000 series
- Configured with provided Google API key: `AIzaSyCTJE686uNxe-ndlGpiW79ThvlFqPF1l4Q`
- Updated model to `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` throughout
- Created complete docker-compose configuration with health checks
- Successfully started Tahoe service in Docker

### 3. API Implementation 
- Created REST endpoints for:
  - Agent creation (`POST /agents`)
  - Agent execution (`POST /agents/{agent_id}/execute`)
  - Session management (`POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{session_id}`)
  - Health checks (`GET /health`)
- Implemented service token authentication
- Fixed Runner initialization (added required `app_name` parameter)

## Current State

### Working:
- Docker container running and healthy on port 9000
- API responding to health checks
- Agent creation endpoint functional
- Service token authentication working

### Issue Encountered:
- Agent execution endpoint fixed (Runner now has app_name)
- Agents are ephemeral (lost on container restart) - expected behavior for POC
- Ready for full agent execution testing

### Files Modified:
- `/src/tahoe/api/main.py` - Fixed Runner initialization
- All templates updated to use `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- Docker configuration optimized for development
- `.env` file created with API key

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Test Agent Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Create agent
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/agents" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer development_token_change_in_production" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "test_assistant",
       "type": "llm",
       "description": "A test assistant",
       "config": {
         "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite",
         "instruction": "You are a helpful assistant."
       }
     }'
   
   # Execute agent
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:9000/agents/test_assistant/execute" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer development_token_change_in_production" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "agent_id": "test_assistant",
       "input": "What is 2+2?"
     }'
   ```

2. **Verify Workflow Agents**:
   - Test sequential workflow creation
   - Test parallel agent execution
   - Validate state management between agents

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Test conversation continuity
   - Verify state management

## Environment Details

- **Docker**: Container `tahoe-tahoe-1` running
- **Port**: 9000 (API), health checks passing
- **Model**: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
- **API Key**: Configured and working
- **Auth Token**: development_token_change_in_production

## Key Discoveries

1. **ADK Runner Requirements**: Runner class requires `app_name` parameter
2. **ADK Architecture**: Framework provides complete orchestration - we just need configuration layer
3. **Model Availability**: gemini-2.5-flash-lite is accessible with provided key
4. **Docker Hot Reload**: Working with volume mounts for `/src` directory
