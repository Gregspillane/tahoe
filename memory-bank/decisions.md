# Project Tahoe - Key Decisions Log

## 2025-08-13: R2-T2 Task Validation and ADK Documentation Verification (Evening - Session 6)

### Decision: Task Validation Process is Essential for Quality
**Context**: R2-T2 Agent Factory task had multiple critical misalignments with MASTERPLAN
**Decision**: Mandatory validation of task specifications against MASTERPLAN before implementation
**Rationale**:
- MASTERPLAN is definitive architectural reference with detailed implementation guidance
- Task specifications may contain outdated or incorrect assumptions
- Validation prevents building wrong implementations that require later refactoring
- Early detection of issues saves significant development time
**Impact**: R2-T2 corrected comprehensively - ModelRegistry simplified, error handling added, ADK classes verified

### Decision: ADK Documentation Verification is Required
**Context**: Task referenced unverified ADK classes and patterns
**Decision**: All ADK components must be verified against official Google ADK documentation
**Rationale**:
- Ensures correct class names, methods, and constructor parameters
- Prevents runtime errors from incorrect ADK usage
- Official documentation provides authoritative patterns and best practices
- Custom patterns (like AgentFactory) need verification that they don't conflict with ADK
**Impact**: Confirmed LlmAgent is correct class, verified constructor parameters, validated no official AgentFactory exists

### Decision: Configuration-Only ModelRegistry Approach
**Context**: Original task over-engineered ModelRegistry with API integration
**Decision**: Implement ModelRegistry as pure configuration lookup without API calls
**Rationale**:
- MASTERPLAN shows static configuration pattern (lines 829-942)
- KISS principle: simplest solution that meets requirements
- API availability checking adds complexity without immediate value
- Focus on core agent factory functionality first
**Impact**: Simplified ModelRegistry specification, reduced implementation complexity

### Decision: Mocked Dependencies for Unit Testing
**Context**: Task originally specified real API calls in unit tests
**Decision**: Use mocked dependencies for reliable unit testing
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests must be fast, reliable, and not dependent on external services
- Real API calls in tests create flaky test suite
- Production integration tested separately from unit functionality
- Allows testing error conditions without triggering real API errors
**Impact**: More reliable test suite, faster development cycle

## 2025-08-13: Critical Architecture Remediation (Evening - Session 5)

### Decision: ELIMINATE ALL Mock/Stub References - Production-First Architecture
**Context**: Task specifications contained mock/stub language inconsistent with production architecture
**Decision**: Systematically remove ALL mock references and specify real Google ADK/Gemini integration
**Rationale**:
- Building production-ready service from day one, not prototype
- Mock architecture leads to technical debt and delayed real integration  
- Google API key available, no cost concerns for development
- Fail-fast philosophy: better to catch integration issues early
- Clean architecture: real dependencies from start, not workarounds
**Impact**: 
- 6 task files completely rewritten for real LLM integration
- All R2/R3 tasks now specify actual Gemini API calls
- Environment requirements updated: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` mandatory
- Production architecture enforced throughout

### Decision: Task Validation Process Required
**Context**: R2-T2 task had critical misalignments with MASTERPLAN
**Decision**: All task specifications must be validated against MASTERPLAN before implementation
**Rationale**:
- MASTERPLAN is definitive architectural reference
- Task files were created before MASTERPLAN was complete
- Prevents building incorrect implementations
- Ensures production-ready specifications
**Impact**: Validation process catches architectural misalignments early

### Decision: Real LLM Integration is Non-Negotiable
**Context**: Previous decisions suggested mock-first development
**Decision**: No mocks, stubs, or placeholders - real Google ADK/Gemini throughout
**Rationale**:
- Pre-launch status allows establishing clean architecture
- No technical debt from mock implementations
- Real integration testing from day one
- Production patterns established early
**Impact**: All specialist agents use real LLM capabilities, not rule-based logic

## 2025-08-13: R2 Task Validation (Evening - Session 3)

### Decision: Validate Tasks Against MASTERPLAN Before Implementation
**Context**: R2-T1 task specification had several misalignments with MASTERPLAN
**Decision**: Thoroughly validate each task against MASTERPLAN before implementation
**Rationale**:
- Original task specs were created before full MASTERPLAN was complete
- MASTERPLAN contains critical implementation details not in original tasks
- Validation prevents rework and ensures correct architecture
- Stub classes maintain proper interfaces for future integration
**Impact**: R2-T1 corrected, other R2 tasks should be validated before implementation

### Decision: Use Stub Classes Instead of Pure Mocks
**Context**: R2-T1 needed placeholder implementations for AgentFactory and ResultAggregator
**Decision**: Create stub classes with proper interfaces rather than inline mocks
**Rationale**:
- Maintains correct interface contracts from the start
- Easier to replace with real implementations later
- Prevents interface drift between components
- Better testing and validation
**Impact**: Created stub implementations for AgentFactory and ResultAggregator

### Decision: Include ADK Imports From Start
**Context**: Original task delayed ADK integration until later
**Decision**: Import ADK classes even when using mock implementations
**Rationale**:
- MASTERPLAN shows ADK as core dependency from line 309
- Maintains correct import structure
- Prevents major refactoring later
- ADK interfaces guide mock implementations
**Impact**: All orchestrator code will use proper ADK imports

## 2025-08-13: R1-T3 API Implementation (Evening - Session 2)

### Decision: Orchestrator Skeleton Pattern
**Context**: Need to implement API endpoints before full orchestration logic
**Decision**: Created orchestrator as skeleton class with mock results
**Rationale**:
- Allows API testing without complex agent logic
- Establishes interface contract early
- Enables incremental development
- Returns realistic mock data for testing
**Impact**: Full orchestration deferred to R2, API fully functional now

### Decision: Comprehensive Endpoint Coverage
**Context**: R1-T3 originally had basic endpoints, masterplan had more
**Decision**: Implemented all masterplan endpoints in R1-T3
**Rationale**:
- Complete API surface even in foundation phase
- Easier to test integration points
- Status and metrics endpoints valuable immediately
**Impact**: R1-T3 now includes status, metrics, and full CRUD operations

## 2025-08-13: Task Alignment Updates (Evening - Session 1)

### Decision: Standardize on Port 8001
**Context**: MASTERPLAN had inconsistent references to port 8000 vs 8001
**Decision**: Updated all references to use port 8001 consistently
**Rationale**:
- Port 8001 avoids more common conflicts
- Already established in task specifications
- Consistent with infrastructure decisions
**Impact**: MASTERPLAN.md updated throughout, all tasks use 8001

### Decision: Enhance R1-T3 Task Specification
**Context**: R1-T3 task was missing some endpoints from masterplan
**Decision**: Added /status/analysis/{id}, PUT /agents/templates/{id}, and /metrics endpoints
**Rationale**:
- Complete API surface even in foundation phase
- Status endpoint useful for monitoring
- Metrics endpoint helps with observability
**Impact**: R1-T3 now includes all masterplan endpoints

## 2025-08-13: Database Implementation Session (Evening)

### Decision: Infrastructure as Separate Service
**Context**: Discussion about where PostgreSQL and Redis should live
**Decision**: Created `/services/infrastructure/` with shared PostgreSQL and Redis
**Rationale**:
- Single PostgreSQL instance with multiple schemas is more efficient
- Single Redis instance with namespaced keys reduces overhead
- Easier backups, monitoring, and management
- Matches production architecture (RDS + ElastiCache)
**Impact**: All services connect to shared infrastructure, not embedded databases

### Decision: Prisma with Computed Config Fields
**Context**: Config management needs both component values and computed URLs
**Decision**: Use Pydantic computed fields for DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL
**Rationale**:
- Components (host, port, user) configurable individually
- URLs computed from components
- Flexibility for different environments
**Impact**: DATABASE_URL must be exported separately for Prisma CLI

### Decision: Enhanced Config.py
**Context**: Need environment-aware configuration
**Decision**: Added computed fields for service URLs, CORS, debug mode
**Rationale**:
- Service URLs change based on environment (dev/staging/prod)
- CORS origins computed based on environment
- Debug mode automatic in development
**Impact**: More intelligent configuration with less manual setup

## 2025-08-13: Implementation Session (Afternoon)

### Decision: Infrastructure as Service
**Context**: Needed to organize infrastructure in monorepo
**Decision**: Moved infrastructure to `/services/infrastructure/`
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with monorepo pattern where everything is a service
- Each service (including infrastructure) can have its own DNS
- Cleaner organization
**Impact**: Infrastructure docker-compose moved from root to services folder

### Decision: Port 8001 is Correct
**Context**: Discrepancy between masterplan (8000) and task spec (8001)
**Decision**: Keep port 8001 as specified in tasks
**Rationale**:
- Task specifications are the execution plan
- Port 8001 avoids more conflicts
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect correct port
**Impact**: All configurations use port 8001

### Decision: Flexible Dependency Versioning
**Context**: FastAPI and google-adk had Starlette version conflicts
**Decision**: Use >= instead of pinned versions in requirements.txt
**Rationale**:
- Allows pip to resolve compatible versions
- More flexible for future updates
- Avoids manual version management
**Impact**: Dependencies can float to compatible versions

## 2025-08-13: Task Planning Session (Morning)

### Decision: Port Configuration Change
**Context**: Discovered port conflicts with existing local services
**Decision**: Changed default ports to avoid conflicts
- PostgreSQL: 5432 → 5435
- Redis: 6379 → 6382
- API: 8000 → 8001
**Rationale**: Allow parallel development without stopping other services
**Impact**: All task specifications and documentation updated

### Decision: Task Specification Format
**Context**: Need executable specifications for Claude Code
**Decision**: Created YAML-based task specifications with structured format
**Rationale**: 
- YAML provides clear structure and readability
- Each task fits in single Claude Code session
- Includes validation steps for autonomous verification
**Impact**: 10 task files created with consistent structure

### Decision: Release Structure
**Context**: Need to organize development into manageable phases
**Decision**: Three releases (R1 Foundation, R2 Orchestration, R3 Specialists)
**Rationale**:
- Progressive complexity building
- Each release provides working functionality
- Dependencies clearly defined
**Impact**: Clear development sequence established

### Decision: Shared Context Document
**Context**: Tasks need consistent patterns and configurations
**Decision**: Created shared project-context.md for all tasks
**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth for patterns
- Reduces repetition in task files
- Maintains consistency across implementations
**Impact**: All tasks reference shared context
