# Project Tahoe - Progress Tracking

## Completed ‚úÖ

### Task Structure Creation
- [x] Created tasks directory structure
- [x] Generated `releases.yaml` master release plan (7 releases, 33 tasks)
- [x] Created `project-context.md` for persistent context
- [x] Created `adk-patterns.md` with verified ADK patterns
- [x] Generated all R1 Foundation task files (5 tasks)
- [x] Created validation script `validate-tasks.py`
- [x] Created `task-dependencies.md` with full dependency graph

### R1 Foundation Implementation
- [x] **r1-t01-project-setup.yaml - IMPLEMENTED** ‚úÖ
  - Created monorepo structure with services/agent-engine
  - Set up Python 3.12 virtual environment
  - Installed Google ADK (v1.10.0) and all dependencies
  - Created FastAPI application with health endpoint
  - Set up Docker configuration (docker-compose.yml)
  - Initialized environment configuration files
  - Verified all ADK imports work correctly
  - Tested FastAPI server on port 8001

### R1 Foundation Tasks (Ready for Implementation)
- [ ] r1-t02-adk-verification.yaml - ADK component verification
- [ ] r1-t03-specification-system.yaml - YAML/JSON parser
- [ ] r1-t04-database-setup.yaml - PostgreSQL with Prisma
- [ ] r1-t05-configuration-loader.yaml - Configuration system

## In Progress üîÑ

  - [ ] r2-t01: Agent factory base
  - [ ] r2-t02: LLM agent builder
  - [ ] r2-t03: Workflow agents
  - [ ] r2-t04: Custom agents
  - [ ] r2-t05: Runner integration
  - [ ] r2-t06: Composition tests

- [ ] R3 Tools tasks (0/4 complete)
  - [ ] r3-t01: Tool registry
  - [ ] r3-t02: Tool loading
  - [ ] r3-t03: Built-in tools
  - [ ] r3-t04: Tool collections

## Upcoming Work üìã

### Remaining Task Generation
- [ ] R4 Workflows tasks (5 tasks)
- [ ] R5 Sessions tasks (4 tasks)
- [ ] R6 API tasks (5 tasks)
- [ ] R7 Integration tasks (4 tasks)

### Implementation Phase
- [x] Execute r1-t01 (Project Setup) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Execute r1-t02 (ADK Verification) - **NEXT**
- [ ] Execute r1-t03 (Specification System)
- [ ] Execute r1-t04 (Database Setup)
- [ ] Execute r1-t05 (Configuration Loader)
- [ ] Execute R2 Composition tasks
- [ ] Execute R3 Tools tasks
- [ ] Execute R4 Workflows tasks
- [ ] Execute R5 Sessions tasks
- [ ] Execute R6 API tasks
- [ ] Execute R7 Integration tasks

## Key Metrics üìä
- **Task Files Created**: 5/33 (15%)
- **Tasks Implemented**: 1/33 (3%)
- **R1 Progress**: 1/5 tasks complete (20%)
- **Releases Defined**: 7/7 (100%)
- **Documentation**: Core docs complete
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 80-120 hours
- **Time per Task File**: ~15-20 minutes creation
- **Time for r1-t01**: ~30 minutes implementation

## Reference Documents üìö

### Active References
- `MASTERPLAN.md` - Core architecture blueprint
- `tasks/releases.yaml` - Master release plan
- `tasks/project-context.md` - Persistent context
- `tasks/adk-patterns.md` - ADK best practices
- `tasks/task-dependencies.md` - Dependency tracking
- `tasks/validation/validate-tasks.py` - Task validation

### Task Templates
- R1 Foundation tasks serve as templates for remaining tasks
- Each task follows consistent structure with ~500 lines of YAML

## Blockers & Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è
- None currently identified
- ADK successfully installed and working
- Need to add GEMINI_API_KEY to .env before using ADK agents
- Minor warning in ADK about field shadowing (non-critical)

## Next Session Plan üéØ
1. Execute r1-t02: ADK Component Verification
2. Continue with r1-t03 through r1-t05 implementation
3. After R1 complete, create R2 Composition task files
4. Create R3 Tools task files if time permits

## Session History üìÖ
- **2025-08-13 (Morning)**: Created R1 Foundation tasks and project structure
- **2025-08-13 (Evening)**: Implemented r1-t01 project setup successfully
- **Next Session**: r1-t02 ADK verification implementation
