  - All endpoints verified working

**Status**: R1 Foundation Phase COMPLETE! Ready for R2.

### R2 Task Validation (2025-08-13 Evening - Session 3)
- [x] Validated R2-T1 against MASTERPLAN
- [x] Identified missing components and corrections needed
- [x] Updated R2-T1 task YAML with proper alignment

## In Progress
### R2 - Core Orchestration Engine
- [ ] R2-T1: Build orchestration engine - **VALIDATED & READY**
  - Task specification corrected and aligned with MASTERPLAN
  - Ready for implementation in next session
- [ ] R2-T2: Implement agent factory
- [ ] R2-T3: Create model registry
- [ ] R2-T4: Build result aggregation

## Upcoming Work
### R3 - Specialist Agents
- [ ] R3-T1: Compliance specialist agent
- [ ] R3-T2: Quality assessment agent
- [ ] R3-T3: Content analyzer agent

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring and observability
- [ ] Production deployment configuration
- [ ] Validate remaining R2 tasks (T2, T3, T4) against MASTERPLAN

## Task Files Reference
All task specifications are located in `/tasks/` directory:

### Release Overview
- `tasks/releases.yaml` - Master release plan and validation

### Foundation Tasks (R1) - **COMPLETE**
- `tasks/r1-foundation/r1-t1-project-setup.yaml` ✅
- `tasks/r1-foundation/r1-t2-database-schema.yaml` ✅
- `tasks/r1-foundation/r1-t3-basic-api.yaml` ✅

### Orchestration Tasks (R2) - **IN PROGRESS**
- `tasks/r2-orchestration/r2-t1-orchestration-engine.yaml` - **CORRECTED & READY**
- `tasks/r2-orchestration/r2-t2-agent-factory.yaml`
- `tasks/r2-orchestration/r2-t3-model-registry.yaml`
- `tasks/r2-orchestration/r2-t4-result-aggregation.yaml`

### Specialist Agent Tasks (R3)
- `tasks/r3-specialist-agents/r3-t1-compliance-agent.yaml`
- `tasks/r3-specialist-agents/r3-t2-quality-agent.yaml`
- `tasks/r3-specialist-agents/r3-t3-content-analyzer.yaml`

### Shared Resources
- `tasks/shared/project-context.md` - Persistent context for all tasks

## Key Metrics
- **Total Tasks Specified**: 10
- **Tasks Completed**: 3 (R1 complete)
- **Tasks Validated**: 1 (R2-T1)
- **Tasks Ready**: 1 (R2-T1)
- **Releases Planned**: 3
- **Estimated Sessions**: 10 (one per task)
- **Sessions Used**: 3

## Notes
- Each task is designed to fit within a single Claude Code session
- Tasks build progressively - R1 must complete before R2
- All tasks include local validation steps
- KISS principle emphasized throughout
- Task validation against MASTERPLAN improves accuracy
