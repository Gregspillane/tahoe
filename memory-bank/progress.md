## Reference Documents üìö

### Active References
- `MASTERPLAN.md` - Core architecture blueprint
- `tasks/releases.yaml` - Master release plan
- `tasks/project-context.md` - Persistent context
- `tasks/adk-patterns.md` - ADK best practices
- `tasks/task-dependencies.md` - Dependency tracking
- `tasks/validation/validate-tasks.py` - Task validation

### Task Templates
- R1 Foundation tasks serve as templates for remaining tasks
- Each task follows consistent structure with ~500 lines of YAML

## Blockers & Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è

### **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE ISSUE** üö®
- **Monorepo Violation**: Infrastructure was incorrectly mixed into agent-engine service
- **Service Isolation Broken**: Services are not properly separated for independent deployment
- **MASTERPLAN Deviation**: Current structure violates the defined monorepo architecture
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy services to separate DNS/domains as required

### Previously Resolved
- ADK patterns validated and compliant ‚úÖ
- Configuration system handles missing API keys gracefully ‚úÖ
- All infrastructure services configured ‚úÖ

## Next Session Plan üéØ
1. Execute r1-t03: Specification System (YAML/JSON parser)
2. Execute r1-t04: Database Setup with Prisma 
3. Execute r1-t05: Configuration Loader System (extensions)
4. Begin R2 Composition implementation
5. Continue with systematic task implementation
