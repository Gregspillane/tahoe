# Project Tahoe - Progress Tracking

## Completed ✅

### Task Structure Creation
- [x] Created tasks directory structure
- [x] Generated `releases.yaml` master release plan (7 releases, 33 tasks)
- [x] Created `project-context.md` for persistent context
- [x] Created `adk-patterns.md` with verified ADK patterns
- [x] Generated all R1 Foundation task files (5 tasks)
- [x] Created validation script `validate-tasks.py`
- [x] Created `task-dependencies.md` with full dependency graph

### R1 Foundation Tasks (Ready for Implementation)
- [x] r1-t01-project-setup.yaml - Project foundation and ADK environment
- [x] r1-t02-adk-verification.yaml - ADK component verification
- [x] r1-t03-specification-system.yaml - YAML/JSON parser
- [x] r1-t04-database-setup.yaml - PostgreSQL with Prisma
- [x] r1-t05-configuration-loader.yaml - Configuration system

## In Progress 🔄

### Task File Generation
- [ ] R2 Composition tasks (0/6 complete) - **NEXT PRIORITY**
  - [ ] r2-t01: Agent factory base
  - [ ] r2-t02: LLM agent builder
  - [ ] r2-t03: Workflow agents
  - [ ] r2-t04: Custom agents
  - [ ] r2-t05: Runner integration
  - [ ] r2-t06: Composition tests

- [ ] R3 Tools tasks (0/4 complete) - **NEXT PRIORITY**
  - [ ] r3-t01: Tool registry
  - [ ] r3-t02: Tool loading
  - [ ] r3-t03: Built-in tools
  - [ ] r3-t04: Tool collections

## Upcoming Work 📋

### Remaining Task Generation
- [ ] R4 Workflows tasks (5 tasks)
- [ ] R5 Sessions tasks (4 tasks)
- [ ] R6 API tasks (5 tasks)
- [ ] R7 Integration tasks (4 tasks)

### Implementation Phase (After Task Generation)
- [ ] Execute R1 Foundation tasks
- [ ] Execute R2 Composition tasks
- [ ] Execute R3 Tools tasks
- [ ] Execute R4 Workflows tasks
- [ ] Execute R5 Sessions tasks
- [ ] Execute R6 API tasks
- [ ] Execute R7 Integration tasks

## Key Metrics 📊
- **Task Files Created**: 5/33 (15%)
- **Releases Defined**: 7/7 (100%)
- **Documentation**: Core docs complete
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 80-120 hours
- **Time per Task File**: ~15-20 minutes creation

## Reference Documents 📚

### Active References
- `MASTERPLAN.md` - Core architecture blueprint
- `tasks/releases.yaml` - Master release plan
- `tasks/project-context.md` - Persistent context
- `tasks/adk-patterns.md` - ADK best practices
- `tasks/task-dependencies.md` - Dependency tracking
- `tasks/validation/validate-tasks.py` - Task validation

### Task Templates
- R1 Foundation tasks serve as templates for remaining tasks
- Each task follows consistent structure with ~500 lines of YAML

## Blockers & Risks ⚠️
- None currently identified
- ADK documentation verified and accessible
- Task structure proven with R1 completion

## Next Session Plan 🎯
1. Create R2 Composition task files (6 tasks)
2. Create R3 Tools task files (4 tasks)
3. Run validation script to ensure quality
4. Update dependency graph if needed

## Session History 📅
- **2025-08-13**: Created R1 Foundation tasks and project structure
- **Next Session**: R2-R3 task generation
