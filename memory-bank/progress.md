## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### ADK Dev UI Integration Failures
- **Issue**: Dev UI shows directories (config, scripts, specs, src) instead of agents in dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Fundamental misunderstanding of ADK agent discovery and registration
- **Impact**: Visual development interface completely non-functional for agent testing
- **Technical Debt**: Multiple incorrect ADK integration approaches layered on top of each other

### Required Fixes for Next Session
1. **Research proper ADK agent registration patterns** - Study official examples
2. **Redesign agent discovery mechanism** - Fix how agents are exposed to ADK Dev UI
3. **Simplify ADK integration** - Remove complex custom composition system for Dev UI
4. **Test with minimal working example** - Start with basic ADK agent before adding complexity
