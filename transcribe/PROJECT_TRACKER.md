# Transcription Service - MVP Project Tracker

**Version**: 1.0 MVP  
**Status**: Active Development  
**Reference**: `/memory-bank/archive/masterplan.md`  
**Last Updated**: [Session Date]

---

## MVP Scope

Building a functional transcription service with production architecture but MVP hardening:
- Full multi-provider transcription (AssemblyAI + OpenAI gpt-4o-transcribe)
- GPT-5-mini reconciliation for accuracy
- Proper queue-based processing with Redis/Bull
- PostgreSQL with Prisma for data management
- S3 for file storage
- Basic API endpoints

**Core Principle**: Production architecture, MVP polish. Build it right, but don't over-engineer.

  - Submit transcription endpoint
  - Status checking endpoint
  - Retrieve transcript endpoint
  - Simple webhook notifications
  - **Output**: Functional API for integration

---

## Session Management

### Handoff Protocol
**End of session**: Update `/memory-bank/context.md` with:
- Task completed
- Key decisions made
- Next task to tackle
- Any blockers

**Start of session**: 
```bash
# Reference current task from tracker
"Continue with task X.X from the project tracker"
```

### Flexibility Points
- Combine small tasks if momentum is good
- Split complex tasks if needed
- Skip non-critical features for MVP
- Add hardening tasks after MVP works

### Key Decisions to Track
- [ ] Webhook implementation (polling vs webhooks for AssemblyAI)
- [ ] Error retry strategy (exponential backoff details)
- [ ] Reconciliation prompt optimization
- [ ] Queue concurrency settings

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# For next session:
claude  # Start Claude Code
# "Let's implement Phase 4 - Intelligent Reconciliation using GPT-5-mini to resolve discrepancies between AssemblyAI and Google Speech transcription results."

# Current working commands:
docker-compose up -d postgres redis  # Start dependencies
python main.py  # Start the service (auto-reload enabled)

# Test commands:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9100/test/submit-job?audio_file_url=s3://test.mp3"
curl "http://localhost:9100/test/job-status/{job_id}"
curl "http://localhost:9100/status"  # Queue metrics
```

## What We're NOT Doing (Yet)
- Advanced monitoring/metrics
- Comprehensive webhook system  
- Multiple output formats beyond MD/JSON
- Admin UI
- Cost optimization
- Performance tuning
- Extensive error recovery
- Security hardening
- Rate limiting
- Caching layers

*These can be added after MVP proves the core concept*
