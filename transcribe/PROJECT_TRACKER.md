## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# For next session:
claude  # Start Claude Code
# "Complete production-ready transcription service with all core functionality operational. Primary remaining task: resolve S3 credential issues for real audio file validation, then focus on performance testing and production deployment."

# Current working commands:
docker-compose up -d  # Start containerized service

# Service endpoints:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9100/test/submit-job?audio_file_url=s3://test.mp3"
curl "http://localhost:9100/test/job-status/{job_id}"
curl "http://localhost:9100/status"  # Queue metrics
curl "http://localhost:9100/health"  # Service health

# Testing commands:
python -m pytest tests/regression/ -v  # Run regression tests
cd tests/integration && python test_api_keys.py  # Validate API keys

# Next priorities:
# 1. Resolve S3 credential issues for real audio testing
# 2. Performance validation with production workloads  
# 3. Production deployment and monitoring setup
```
