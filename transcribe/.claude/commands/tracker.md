Based on your analysis, create a tracking file to guide implementation. Name it after what we're building (e.g., PROVIDER_REFACTOR.md).

Include:

## Goal
Clear one-line summary of what we're achieving and why

## Current State
Brief snapshot of relevant files/components and their current implementation approach

## Plan
Numbered implementation steps with enough detail to be actionable:
1. First concrete action (mention specific files/functions to modify)
2. Second concrete action 
3. ...

## Progress
- [ ] Step 1 - [specific deliverable]
- [ ] Step 2 - [specific deliverable]
- [ ] ...

## Key Files
List main files that will be modified:
- `path/to/file.ts` - what changes here
- `path/to/other.ts` - what changes here

## Context & Decisions
- Critical constraints or requirements
- Key architectural decisions made
- Important patterns to follow/avoid
- Dependencies or gotchas discovered

## Session Notes
### Session 1 - [date]
- What was completed
- Any blockers or issues found
- Where to pick up next

## Verification
Specific tests or checks to confirm success:
- [ ] Test X still passes
- [ ] Feature Y works as before
- [ ] New capability Z functions correctly

Keep entries concise but specific. Update progress and session notes as you work. This file is our source of truth across sessions.
